# ML-Classified

This repository is a personal learning workspace for machine learning concepts and implementations.

## Learning Roadmap

This roadmap tracks the topics I'll study and the code/notebooks I create while learning.

- Univariate Linear Regression (current) — `Univariate_Linear_Regression_From_Scratch.ipynb`


Goals:

- Understand algorithms by implementing them from scratch.
- Create small, well-documented notebooks and reusable Python modules.

Progress:

- [x] Univariate Linear Regression — notebook created and explanation improved.

Files to check:

- `Univariate_Linear_Regression_From_Scratch.ipynb` — see notebook for code and explanations.

Next steps:

- Create `topics/linear_regression/` and add a script-based implementation (`src/linear_regression.py`).
- Add tests under `tests/`.
